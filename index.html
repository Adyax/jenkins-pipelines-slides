# JENKINS 2 PIPELINES AS A CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION PLATFORM FOR DRUPAL

# What is (deployment) pipeline

From Martin Fowler: "A deployment pipeline is a way to deal with this by breaking up your build into stages."

## Jenkins pipelines

From Jenkins official site: (TBE)

Pipelines are Jenkins jobs enabled by the Pipeline (formerly called "workflow") plugin and built with simple text scripts that use a Pipeline DSL (domain-specific language) based on the Groovy programming language.

Pipelines leverage the power of multiple steps to execute both simple and complex tasks according to parameters that you establish. Once created, pipelines can build code and orchestrate the work required to drive applications from commit to delivery.

# What we had

## - redundant pointing-and-clicking in Jenkins admin interface
## - many jobs that do almost same things differently
## - no common strategy for standard things like emails config, build discarding, etc
## - lots of deployment technical debt
