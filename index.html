I want to present our session named JENKINS 2 PIPELINES AS A CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION PLATFORM FOR DRUPAL. The name for this session is not very correct as we are going to show you much more interesting stuff then just Continuous Integration. You'll have some theory first and than we'll show you some real examples of using pipelines.

<h2>
Principles of successfull software delivery
</h2>
<p class="fragment">Repeatable and reliable process</p>
<p class="fragment">Automate (almost) everything</p>
<p class="fragment">Put everything in version control</p>
<p class="fragment">If it hurts - do it more frequently</p>
<p class="fragment">Done means released</p>
<p class="fragment"></p>
<p class="fragment">Everybody is responsible</p>
<aside class="notes">
Releasing software should be easy. It should be easy because you have tested every single part of the release process hundreds of times before. It should be as simple as pressing a button. The repeatability and reliability derive from two principles: automate almost everything, and keep everything you need to build, deploy, test, and release your application in version control.

The process for releasing/deploying software MUST be repeatable and reliable. This leads onto the 2nd principle…
<br/>
Automate everything! A manual deployment can never be described as repeatable and reliable (not if I’m doing it anyway!). You have to invest seriously in automating all the tasks you do repeatedly, and this tends to lead to reliability.
<br/>
If somethings difficult or painful, do it more often. On the surface this sounds silly, but basically what this means is that doing something painful, more often, will lead you to improve it, probably automate it, and this will eventually make it painless and easy. Take for example doing a deployment of a database schema. If this is tricky, you tend to not do it very often, you put it off, maybe you’ll do 1 a month. Really what you should do is improve the process of doing the schema deployments, get good at it, and do it more often, like 1 a day if needed. If you’re doing something every day, you’re going to be a lot better at it than if you only do it once a month.
<br/>
Keep everything in source control – this sounds like a bit of a weird one in this day and age, I mean seriously, who doesn’t keep everything in source control? Apparently quite a few people. Who knew?
<br/>

Done means “released”. This implies ownership of a project right up until it’s in the hands of the user, and working properly. There’s none of this “I’ve checked in my code so it’s done as far as I’m concerned”. I have been fortunate enough to work with some software teams who eagerly made sure their code changes were working right up to the point when their changes were in production, and then monitored the live system to make sure their changes were successful. On the other hand I’ve worked with teams who though their responsibility ended when they checked their code in to the VCS.
<br/>

Build quality in! Take the time to invest in your quality metrics. A project with good, targeted quality metrics (we could be talking about unit test coverage, code styling, rules violations, complexity measurements – or preferably, all of the above) will invariably be better than one without, and easier to maintain in the long run.
<br/>

Everybody has responsibility for the release process. A program running on a developers laptop isn’t going to make any money for the company. Similarly, a project with no plan for deployment will never get released, and again make no money. Companies make money by getting their products released to customers, therefore, this process should be in the interest of everybody. Developers should develop projects with a mind for how to deploy them. Project managers should plan projects with attention to deployment. Testers should test for deployment defects with as much care and attention as they do for code defects (and this should be automated and built into the deployment task itself).
<br/>

Improve continuously. Don’t sit back and wait for your system to become out of date or impossible to maintain. Continuous improvement means your system will always be evolving and therefore easier to change when needs be.

<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
<aside class="notes">

<section>
<h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>
<p>software strategy that enables organizations to deliver new features to users as fast and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>"Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to Production at any time" - Martin Fowler.</p>

<p>"Continuous Delivery aims to reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering incremental changes to users" - Jez Humble.</p>
<aside class="notes">
Continuous delivery is sometimes confused with continuous deployment. Continuous deployment means that every change is automatically deployed to Production. Continuous delivery means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to Production but may choose not to do it, usually due to business reasons. In order to do continuous deployment one must be doing continuous delivery
</aside>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Continuous Delivery & Feature Branches</h2>
<p>Every successful build on your Master branch should be releasable.</p>
<p>Your feature branches get merged into master, when they have been tested.</p>
<aside class="notes">
</aside>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
Continuous deployment is the next step of continuous delivery: Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to Production automatically.

<section>
<h2>What is (deployment) pipeline</h2>
<blockquote>
"A deployment pipeline is a way to break up your build into stages."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Deployment pipelines are a central part of Continuous Delivery"
</blockquote>
<p>Martin Fowler</p>
- Glue code
<aside class="notes">
- This is a very clean description of pipelines.
- Why we need to break up pipeline into stages? Because we want to have faster feedback.
- We can also think about pipelines as a glue code.
</aside>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The goal of deployment pipeline</h2>
<p class="fragment">it makes every part of the process of building, deploying, testing, and releasing software visible to everybody involved, aiding collaboration.</p>

<p class="fragment">it improves feedback so that problems are identified, and so resolved, as early in the process as possible.</p>

<p class="fragment">it enables teams to deploy and release any version of their software to any environment at will through a fully automated process.</p>

<aside class="notes">
“‘Is software ready?’ means very different things to your individual contributor, your project manager, your product manager, your QA manager, and your operations team,” R. Tyler Croy explained to The New Stack. “The readiness state of software means very different things to every person in the line who’s going to touch, and be involved with delivering software. Bringing that to a more explicit model, like with pipeline-as-code in Jenkins 2.0, gives you collaboration points that didn’t previously exist.”
</aside>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why we need pipelines?</h2>
<p class="fragment">Detect any changes that could lead to problems in Production:<br/>
<i>Security, Performance, Usability, etc</i><p>

<p class="fragment">Enable collaboration between the various groups involved in delivering software</p>

<p class="fragment">Provide visibility about the flow of changes</p>
<aside class="notes">
Those collaboration points are where a project is ready to make a transition from one environment to another: for example, moving from the developer to the QA engineer, who may need to run a smoke test. Then from the QA perspective, software may be “ready,” but only insofar as moving to the next stage. Eventually, a product manager may be at a point to declare the product “ready” to appear before a customer. Even then, in the context of CD, software may never be “done” — just ready to evolve to the next stage.

you need to test built code before it hits Production<br />

CI/CD workflow to deliver code to target environments:
<ul>

Option 1: With tarball, capistrano, sync, etc.

<p class="fragment">
Option 2: CI/CD workflow to deliver code with additional Git repository (target repo).<br/>
<small>Commit to source repo -> CI (Jenkins) -> Build (sh "composer install") -> Commit to target repo -> Deploy to target environment</small>
