# JENKINS 2 PIPELINES AS A CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION PLATFORM FOR DRUPAL

# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Deep-dive
3. Use cases
4. Showtime!

# What is (deployment) pipeline

blablabla

???
From Martin Fowler: "A deployment pipeline is a way to deal with this by breaking up your build into stages."

---

## Jenkins pipelines

From Jenkins official site: (TBE)

Pipelines are Jenkins jobs enabled by the Pipeline (formerly called "workflow") plugin and built with simple text scripts that use a Pipeline DSL (domain-specific language) based on the Groovy programming language.

Pipelines leverage the power of multiple steps to execute both simple and complex tasks according to parameters that you establish. Once created, pipelines can build code and orchestrate the work required to drive applications from commit to delivery.

---

# Why we need pipelines?

---

# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
???
Continuous delivery is sometimes confused with continuous deployment. Continuous deployment means that every change is automatically deployed to production. Continuous delivery means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to production but may choose not to do it, usually due to business reasons. In order to do continuous deployment one must be doing continuous delivery
--

# Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software strategy that enables organizations to deliver new features to users as fast and efficiently as possible.
--

# Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment is the next step of continuous delivery: Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically.

# Pipeline anatomy

## Step

## Node

## Stage

---

## Simple pipeline

Pipeline code:

```groovy
node {
*    echo 'Hello from Pipeline'
}
```

Pipeline execution log:

```groovy
Started by user anonymous
[Pipeline] echo
Hello from Pipeline
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
Finished: SUCCESS
```

# Pipeline as a code
TBA

---

# What we had

## - redundant pointing-and-clicking in Jenkins admin interface
## - many jobs that do almost same things differently
## - no common strategy for standard things like emails config, build discarding, etc
## - lots of deployment technical debt
