<aside class="notes">
I want to present our session named JENKINS 2 PIPELINES AS A CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION PLATFORM FOR DRUPAL. The name for this session is not very correct as we are going to show you much more interesting stuff then just Continuous Integration. You'll have some theory first and than we'll show you some real examples of using pipelines.

<h2>Software delivery & deployment pipeline (AN)</h2>
<p class="fragment grow">Build</p>
<p class="fragment grow">Deploy</p>
<p class="fragment grow">Test</p>
<p class="fragment grow">Release</p>
<p>Deployment pipeline is the automated implementation of these steps.<p>
<aside class="notes">
- The goal of any software development process is to deliver some product to the end users.
- We want to deliver a changes to users in fast, reliable way from development to release.

<h2>Software release antipatterns</h2>
<p class="fragment grow">Manual deploys</p>
<p class="fragment grow">Long release cycles</p>
<p class="fragment grow">Manual configuration of environments</p>
<aside class="notes">
You should only choose version number and click deploy.

<h2>
Principles of successfull software delivery
</h2>
<p class="fragment">
Repeatable and reliable process
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Automate (almost) everything
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Put everything in version control
</p>
<p class="fragment">
If it hurts - do it more frequently
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Done means released
</p>
<p class="fragment">
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Everybody is responsible
</p>
<aside class="notes">
Releasing software should be easy. It should be easy because you have tested every single part of the release process hundreds of times before. It should be as simple as pressing a button. The repeatability and reliability derive from two principles: automate almost everything, and keep everything you need to build, deploy, test, and release your application in version control.

<h2>
Continuous Integration
</h2>
Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

<h2>
Continuous Delivery
</h2>
<p>Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software strategy that enables organizations to deliver new features to users as fast and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>"Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time" - Martin Fowler.</p>

<p>"Continuous Delivery aims to reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering incremental changes to users" - Jez Humble.</p>
<aside class="notes">
Continuous delivery is sometimes confused with continuous deployment. Continuous deployment means that every change is automatically deployed to production. Continuous delivery means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to production but may choose not to do it, usually due to business reasons. In order to do continuous deployment one must be doing continuous delivery

<section>
<h2>
Continuous Delivery & Feature Branches
</h2>
<p>Every successful build on your Master branch should be releasable.</p>
<p>Your feature branches get merged into master, when they have been tested.</p>
<aside class="notes">

<section>
<h2>
Continuous Deployment
</h2>
Continuous deployment is the next step of continuous delivery: Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically.

<h2>
What is (deployment) pipeline
</h2>
"A deployment pipeline is a way to break up your build into stages." - Martin Fowler
- "Deployment pipelines are a central part of Continuous Delivery" - Martin Fowler
- Glue code
<aside class="notes">
- This is a very clean description of pipelines.
- Why we need to break up pipeline into stages? Because we want to have faster feedback.
- We can also think about pipelines as a glue code.

<section>
<h2>
The goal of deployment pipeline (TBE, AN)
</h2>
<p class="fragment">it makes every part of the process of building, deploying, testing, and releasing software visible to everybody involved, aiding collaboration.</p>

<p class="fragment"> it improves feedback so that problems are identified, and so resolved, as early in the process as possible.</p>

<p class="fragment"> it enables teams to deploy and release any version of their software to any environment at will through a fully automated process.</p>

<section>
<h2>
Why we need pipelines?
</h2>
<p class="fragment">Detect any changes that could lead to problems in Production:<br/>
<i>Security, Performance, Usability, etc</i><p>

<p class="fragment">Enable collaboration between the various groups involved in delivering software</p>

<p class="fragment">Provide visibility about the flow of changes</p>

<h2>
Deploy pipelines in Jenkins
</h2>
<p class="fragment">
Enabled by "Pipeline" plugin (formerly known as "Workflow")
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Based on Pipeline DSL (Domain-specific language)
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Pipeline DSL is based on Groovy programming language
</p>
<p class="fragment">
<strong>Resilent</strong> - can survive restarts
</p>
<p class="fragment">
<strong>Pausable</strong> - can pause and wait for human input/approval
</p>
<p class="fragment">
<strong>Efficient</strong> - can restart from saved checkpoints
</p>
<p class="fragment">
<strong>Visualized</strong> - provides status at-a-glance
